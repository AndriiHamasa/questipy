## Setting up environment variables

This project requires environment variables to be set in order to run. A sample file, `env.sample`, has been provided to help you set up your `.env` file.

1. Copy the `env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual configuration values (e.g., database credentials, secret key).
3. Save the file and ensure itâ€™s loaded in your environment (Django will automatically use it if you're using something like `django-environ`).
